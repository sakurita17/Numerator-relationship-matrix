## Numerator relationship matrix

The matrix that indicates the additive genetic relationship among individuals is
called the numerator relationship matrix (A). It is symmetric and the diagonal
element represent twice the probability that two gametes taken at random from 
animal $i$ will carry identical alleles by descent, the inbreeding coefficient 
of animal $i$ (Wright, 1922).
The off-diagonal elements, $a_{ij}$, equals the 
numerator of the coefficient of relationship between animals $i$ and $j$. 
When multiplied by the additive genetic variance $\sigma_u$, $A_\sigma_u$ is 
the covariance among breeding values. $A$ is twice the coefficient of parentage.

However, we can face memory bottlenecks, when we need to compute big pedigree.

1) Pedigree
2) Recursive method (Tabular)
3) Thompson's method 
4) Henderson's method
